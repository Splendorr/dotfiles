Forked from the great https://github.com/jqr/dotfiles

With a few minor tweaks by me, probably more as I go along and learn more about customizing these things.

Symlink all the dotfiles into the appropriate locations:

  rake install
  
Other things I do when I set up a Mac for the first time:

1. 
2. Install homebrew http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
